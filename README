canvas_issues - Take assignments from a Canvas and make them Github issues.

Runs as a AWS lambda function and a single json file in S3 for state to keep costs low.

Simply setup the function with CloudWatch Events with schedule expression "rate(15 minutes)".

The Lambda function role needs this policy:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::some-bucket.db/*"
        }
    ]
}
